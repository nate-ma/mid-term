* [X] 1. We have defined a variable twitter. Use dot notation to add a key called 'stockPrice' and set it equal to 18.

* [X] 2. Use bracket notation to add a key called 'ceo' and set it equal to 'Jack Dorsey'.

* [X] 3. We have given you a variable 'twittersAddress'. Add this to the twitter object with the key 'address', however you'd like (without altering where we define the twitter object on lines 2-6). What notation did you use to add this to the object?

* [X] 4. Add an array of strings, each representing a tweet, to your twitter object in whatever way you'd like. You make up the name of the key and the tweets (just 2-3 is fine).

* [X] 5. Loop through the array of tweets print each to the console.

* [X] 6. Invoke the countCharacters function we've given you on line 3, by passing in the SECOND tweet in your array. Add a comment saying what you think this function will return.

* [X] 7. Loop through the twitter object and print each KEY to the console.
